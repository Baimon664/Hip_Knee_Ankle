Kamil Kwolek, Measuring Lower Limb Alignment and Joint Orientation Using Deep Learning Based Segmentation of Bones (2019) ([link to publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336345786))

This work presented a deep learning approach to measuring lower limb alignment and joint orientation using an U-Net based neural architecture to segment the bones with only fifty annotated X-ray images. This experiments demonstrated that the experimental results are promising and the proposed approach has a potential.
